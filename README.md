# SUR_MUSIC_PLAYER
For my recent project, I applied my skills in HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS3 to create a fully functional music player application called "Sur." This project involved building a responsive and user-friendly interface that allows users to play, pause, skip, and shuffle through songs. Here's how I applied each technology:

HTML5:
HTML5 served as the backbone of the application, structuring the player layout and providing elements like buttons, sliders, and audio controls. I leveraged the <audio> element, which allowed me to embed audio files directly into the webpage. Additionally, HTML5 features like semantic elements and custom data attributes helped in organizing and managing different audio tracks for smoother integration with JavaScript.

JavaScript:
JavaScript was essential for implementing the dynamic functionalities of the player. I used event listeners to handle user inputs like play/pause buttons, volume adjustments, and track navigation (next/previous). JavaScript also controlled the playlist, allowing users to add or remove tracks dynamically. I incorporated the Web Audio API for more control over audio playback, including the visualization of audio waveforms and real-time updates on the track's progress. JavaScript helped me ensure that the player was interactive and responsive to user actions.

CSS3:
With CSS3, I crafted a visually appealing and responsive design. I used Flexbox and Grid layouts to ensure that the music player could adapt to various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices. CSS transitions and animations were applied to give the user interface a smooth and polished feel, such as fading effects when switching between songs or changing the volume slider. I also utilized media queries to enhance the app's responsiveness.
